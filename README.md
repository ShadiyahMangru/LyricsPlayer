# LyricsPlayer
LyricsPlayer contains a Song Library where users may store song identifiers and lyrics.  The initial “Create A Playlist” GUI allows users to create a custom playlist from the Song Library, of user-defined length and song content.  Once the playlist creation step is complete, a second GUI presents the user with his/her custom song lyrics playlist.
